First I had edited the code from lesson 5 to add a timing feature and used metaclasses.
I ran data_expander.py to create a larger dataset, then ran that and the smaller file from a previous lesson through database.py. 

The timings output showed: 

Function: clear_all
 Time: 0:00:00.059386
Function: import_data
 Time: 0:00:07.586036
 Records Processed: (10000, 10000, 10000)
Function: import_data
 Time: 0:00:00.021754
 Records Processed: (4, 3, 3)
Function: show_available_products
 Time: 0:00:00.058106
Function: show_rentals
 Time: 0:00:00.027663


Adding data to a database takes time and the larger the datafile that's being inputted 
the longer it will take to run the code that does the inputting.
